## Comprehensive Linear Regression Modeling Project

### This repository documents a comprehensive linear regression modeling project undertaken as part of my learning journey in statistical modeling

Key steps involved:

- Data Acquisition and Preparation: Sourcing the dataset.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic visualizing data distributions, identifying relationships between variables, and understanding the underlying patterns.

- Model Building: Constructing a linear regression model using statsmodels.api.

- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as R-squared, RMSE, and MAE, as well as residual analysis.

- Interpretation: Understanding the coefficients and their significance in the context of the problem.

- Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
